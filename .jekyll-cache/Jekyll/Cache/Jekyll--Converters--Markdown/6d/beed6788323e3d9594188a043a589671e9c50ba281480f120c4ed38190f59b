I"j<p>I have recently been asking the question of why many big companies, most of them with enough resources and great employees, fail miserably in innovating and competing in the 21st century. Why is it so difficult for them to transition from the old systems of running the business to the modern setting that powers the most valuable companies in the world?</p>
