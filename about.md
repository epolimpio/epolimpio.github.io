I'm [Eduardo Olimpio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardo-olimpio-b7868931/) and this is my personal notebook as a blog. I'm a scientist that has worked in several fields: military technology, financial risk, biotech. Since 2016 I work in tech companies building products for humans. Here I collect the knowledge from this diverse background to tech and explore new paths programming out of my comfort zone.
